ArcBridge automatically uploads arcdps logs, summarizes WvW fights, and sends clean, readable reports to Discord or the web so your squad can review quickly.

## ✨ What it does for you

- **🚀 Automatic uploads**: Watch your arcdps log folder and upload every fight as it ends.
- **📊 WvW fight breakdowns**: See squad vs enemy sizes, damage, downs/deaths, cleanses, strips, stability, healing, and more.
- **🏆 Rankings & MVPs**: Identify top performers by role and stat category across your sessions.
- **💬 Discord-ready summaries**: Post clean embeds or shareable report images straight to your server.
- **🌐 Persistent web reports**: Publish a GitHub Pages report you can share with your squad anytime.
- **🖱️ Manual control when you want it**: Drag & drop a single log to upload or re-run a report.
