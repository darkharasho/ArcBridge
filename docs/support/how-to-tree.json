Configure the log directory.\n2. Add one or more `.zevtc` files (manual or watched ingestion).\n3. Wait for status transitions (`queued -> uploading -> success`, or error states).\n4. Verify fight cards include metadata (fight name, time, links, and computed details).\n\n## Common first-run checks\n\n- If no logs appear, verify the folder path and permissions.\n- If uploads fail, review status text and your webhook/token configuration.\n- If details are delayed, wait for parsing and aggregation to complete."

Connect ArcBridge to GitHub (authorization flow).\n2. Pick an existing report repository or create a new one.\n3. Confirm the GitHub Pages URL is set.\n4. Choose a theme/logo (optional).\n5. Upload a report and verify the published page.\n\n## Key terms (quick glossary)\n\n- **Repository (repo)**: an online folder for files.\n- **Branch**: a version stream in a repo (usually `main`).\n- **GitHub Pages**: GitHub's static website hosting.\n- **Token/Auth**: permission ArcBridge needs to upload files for you.\n- **Build status**: indicates whether Pages has finished publishing updates.\n\n## Safety and ownership notes\n\n- ArcBridge only works with the repo you select.\n- If auth expires or permissions change, uploads can fail until reconnected.\n- Keep your GitHub account secure (2FA recommended).",

Start connection in ArcBridge\n\n- Open **Settings -> GitHub Web Reports**.\n- Click the connect/authenticate action.\n- ArcBridge will show a short verification code and a GitHub URL.\n\n### 2. Complete verification on GitHub\n\n- Open the provided GitHub verification page.\n- Sign in to your GitHub account (if not already signed in).\n- Enter the code shown by ArcBridge.\n- Approve access when prompted.\n\nAfter approval, ArcBridge should show a connected/authenticated state.\n\n### 3. Choose where reports should be stored\n\nYou can either:\n\n- Select an existing repository, or\n- Create a new repository from ArcBridge.\n\nIf you're new, creating a dedicated repo just for reports is usually easiest.\n\n### 4. Confirm repo details\n\nVerify these values in Settings:\n\n- **Owner**: your GitHub username or org.\n- **Repository name**: target repo for report files.\n- **Branch**: usually `main`.\n- **Pages URL**: generated website URL used for sharing.\n\n## First-time validation checklist\n\n- Auth state says connected.\n- Repo is selectable and saved.\n- Pages URL appears.\n- No current error banner in the GitHub section.\n\n## Common beginner issues\n\n- **Wrong account signed in**: sign out/in on GitHub and reconnect.\n- **Repo not visible**: ensure permissions and refresh repo list.\n- **Connection says error**: retry auth; token may be expired/revoked.\n- **Pages URL missing**: wait for repo setup/template steps, then retry."
